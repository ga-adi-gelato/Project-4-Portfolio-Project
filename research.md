## Card Counting App Study ##

### Background ###
Project 4 requires an app that will be deliverable to the Play Store. I had many ideas but I had to keep in mind the constraints
that we will have for this project. At the same time, because it will be on the Play Store and visible to any potential employers, I
still have to find a topic that will have appeal. As a result, I chose to design a card counting app. The study is for finding out what
people expect to see in a card counting app and figure out how I can get people to use it.

### Goals ###
The goal is to determine how useful participants might find the app, and what features can be included to make them find the app
more useful.

### Methodology ###
The users will be asked a series of questions gauging their knowledge of BlackJack and card counting, as well as their experience in
casinos. Users will also be asked what their expectations are of the app and what features might they like to see. The questionnaire will be
very brief and should not take more than 5 minutes to complete.

### Participants ###
Participants should include adults, especially those that might frequent casinos. These people have the initial money to cover the costs involved
in going to casinos (travel, lodging, bets, etc.) Participants should also gave a decent understanding of math and probability in order for
card counting to be an effective tool.

### Schedule ###
Questions should be completed during the week of 8/22. Presentation should be ready by 8/25.

### Script ###

-How often do you play blackjack?
-How often do you go to a casino?
-How would you rate your understanding of card counting?
-What is your impression of cardcounting as a means of winning money at a casino?
-Would you be more likely to play blackjack at a casino if you were equipped to count cards?
